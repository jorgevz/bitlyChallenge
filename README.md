## Bermuda arrival timer

For this project the user only needs to put the date
as well as the hour and minute of arrival to 
find out how many minutes it took them to arrive to the Bermuda Island. Once the submit button is clicked, it will allow the user to see the minutes it
took them to arrive below in the result section. Here is the deployed link.
